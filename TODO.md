# TODO: Add Projects Section to Login Page

## Tasks
- [ ] Add "Projects" navigation link in header nav before "Login" link
- [ ] Insert the projects section HTML after "study-deadlines" section and before "login" section
- [ ] Ensure navigation links are concise to fit in one line (shorten if necessary, e.g., "Working On" to "Projects" if needed, but keep "Study & Deadlines" as is unless specified)
- [ ] Test the page to ensure the new section renders correctly and navigation works
